# Pomodoro Timer
A pomodoro timer built with JavaScript and Sass.

Pomodoro is a time-keeping strategy whereby you define a period of working time, that will be followed by a fixed break. So you might, for example, choose to work for 25 minutes, followed by a 5 minute break, and then repeat for as long as necessary.

Studies have shown that pomodoro time keeping can lead to heightened productivity. How will it work out for you?
